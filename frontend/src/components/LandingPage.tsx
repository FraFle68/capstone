                <p>
                    The known world ist in trouble. Orks are attacking the free races,
                    Elves and dwarves are fighting each other and the nature is training for
                    the apocalypse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There seems to be nobody who is able to stop the chaos.</p>
                <p>
                    But there is hope.
                    Rumors tell about a potion of power which is hidden in the dungeon of an ancient
                    wizard. The person drinking this potion will be able to save the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You stand in front of this dungeon and your will is to get
                    this potion whatever it may cost you.
                </p>
